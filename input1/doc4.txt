A fish is an amazing animal which lives and breathes in water. Fish have been on the Earth for over 500 million years. All fish have a backbone and most breathe through gills and have fins and scales. Fish have excellent senses of sight, touch, taste and many possess a good sense of smell and ‘hearing’. Most fish have taste buds all over their body. There are 25,000 known species of fish. Fish are cold-blooded, which means their internal body temperature changes as the surrounding temperature changes. Fish eat other fish, fish eggs, mollusks, aquatic plants, algae, insects, water birds, turtles, frogs, snakes and mice. The largest fish is the great whale shark which can reach fifty feet in length. The smallest fish is the Philippine goby that is less than 1/3 of an inch when fully grown. Most fish reproduce by laying eggs, though some fish, such as great white sharks, give birth to live babies called pups I have kept a small fish tank with three gold fish in my house too.  I love fish very much.
